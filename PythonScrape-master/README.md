# PythonScrape - Master
This package was achieved from code 5 years ago. Its intent was to capture information for curiosity sake and to dabble with python.
It is a generalized bucket of code and `output.txt` Its initial intent in a github repo is to access code bases for a variety of needs but mostly exploring a crawler, its techniques and migrations into a database. See the `#Secondary-folder` section below for further explanations of the code in subdirectories.
